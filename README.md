## Repository Structure

This repository showcases my work in data engineering and data analysis. Below is an overview of the main directories:

### 1. data_analysis

The `data_analysis` folder contains projects and scripts focused on extracting insights from data. This includes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial investigations to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying statistical methods to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Visualization:** Creating charts and graphs to represent data findings clearly.

Each project includes detailed documentation to explain methodologies and findings.

### 2. data_engineering

The `data_engineering` folder features projects related to the design and development of data pipelines and architectures. Key areas include:

- **ETL Processes:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from various sources into data warehouses or lakes.
- **Data Modeling:** Designing efficient data models to support analytics and reporting.
- **Automation:** Scripting to automate data workflows and ensure data integrity.

Projects are accompanied by documentation outlining the architecture, tools used, and implementation details.
