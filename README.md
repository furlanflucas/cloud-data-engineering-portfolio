## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Lucas. I love buildingâ€‚scalable, high-performance and fault-tolerant systems. I specializeâ€‚in data engineering, analytics and automation & love optimizing workflows, debugging and building infrastructure that enables data-driven decisions.

I enjoy figuring out complex data challenges such as optimizing ETL pipelines, enhancingâ€‚data models, or increasing system efficiency. Curiosity, adaptability, andâ€‚resilience drive my problem-solving approach and all my uncertainties lead me to find a solution.

I firmly believe inâ€‚using AI to solve problems, improve documentation and help with debugging. AI is a part of my workflow, be it automate things, generating insightful documentation or speed upâ€‚troublesooting. I view it as aâ€‚productivity and ideation amplifier that will let engineers spend time on high-impact projects, not muddling through inefficiency.

Besides the technical capabilities, I think technology need to leadâ€‚the way in innovation, accessibility and ethical obligation. I want to work onâ€‚purposeful things, with teammates with whom I scale and share knowledge.

### ðŸ’¡ Core Values

âœ” **Resourceful** â€“ I figure things out, even when uncertain how they'llâ€‚adapt.
âœ” **Systems** â€“ Iâ€‚optimize processes and build systems that scale.
âœ” **Integrity** â€” I believe in data practices that are ethical, considerateâ€‚and effective.
âœ” **Autonomy & Collaboration** â€“ I appreciate imagining a solutionâ€‚on my own but I love collaborating, too
âœ” **Curiosity**â€‚â€“ I have a view on eternal learning and ahead of forthcoming tech.

## Repository Structure

This repository showcases my work in data engineering and data analysis. Below is an overview of the main directories:

### 1. data_analysis

The `data_analysis` folder contains projects and scripts focused on extracting insights from data. This includes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial investigations to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying statistical methods to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Visualization:** Creating charts and graphs to represent data findings clearly.

Each project includes detailed documentation to explain methodologies and findings.

### 2. data_engineering

The `data_engineering` folder features projects related to the design and development of data pipelines and architectures. Key areas include:

- **ETL Processes:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from various sources into data warehouses or lakes.
- **Data Modeling:** Designing efficient data models to support analytics and reporting.
- **Automation:** Scripting to automate data workflows and ensure data integrity.

Projects are accompanied by documentation outlining the architecture, tools used, and implementation details.
