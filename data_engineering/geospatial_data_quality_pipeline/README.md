# Geospatial Data Quality Monitor

## Overview
This project simulates a geospatial data quality pipeline designed to ensure high-accuracy mapping datasets. It fetches road network data from OpenStreetMap (OSM), detects roads with missing speed limits, and visualizes anomalies using Folium maps within a Streamlit dashboard.

## Industry Relevance
This project mirrors real-world geospatial data validation workflows I contributed to at Cruise, where ensuring high-quality, labeled map data was critical for autonomous vehicle (AV) operations. The methodology used here can be extended to automated QA workflows, similar to the MapChecker AutoQA system and other ETL optimizations I worked on.

## Features
- Fetch road network data for a given location using OpenStreetMap (OSM).
- Detect missing speed limits, identifying potential data quality issues.
- Visualize geospatial anomalies on an interactive Folium map.
- Streamlit dashboard for real-time monitoring.
- Optimized for large-scale geospatial analysis, supporting automated validation workflows.

## Technologies Used
- Python – Core scripting language
- GeoPandas & OSMnx – Geospatial data processing
- Folium – Map visualization
- Streamlit – Interactive dashboard
- Shapely – Geometry operations
- SQL (for future integrations with PostGIS/BigQuery)

## Project Structure

├── data/                  # Directory for storing geospatial data
│   ├── road_data.geojson    # Processed OSM data (auto-generated)
├── data_pipeline.py         # Main script containing the Streamlit app
├── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions
### Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install geopandas folium osmnx shapely streamlit
```

### Run the Streamlit App
Navigate to the project folder and run:
```sh
streamlit run data_pipeline.py
```

### Use the Dashboard
1. Click **"Fetch & Process Data"** to download road network data from OpenStreetMap.
2. Click **"Detect Anomalies"** to find roads missing speed limits.
3. View the interactive Folium map displaying problematic roads.

## How It Works
### 1. Fetch Data from OpenStreetMap
- Uses OSMnx to fetch the road network for a given city.
- Converts it to a GeoDataFrame and saves it as GeoJSON.

### 2. Detect Anomalies (Missing Speed Limits)
- Checks if the `maxspeed` attribute is missing from any roads.
- If missing, marks them as anomalies.

### 3. Visualize on an Interactive Map
- Uses Folium to highlight problematic roads in red.
- Displays tooltips with the road type (`highway` attribute).

## Future Improvements
This project currently runs as a local simulation, but in a production setting, the following enhancements would improve scalability, automation, and cloud integration:

- Store processed data in a geospatial database (PostGIS, BigQuery, or Snowflake).
- Automate data validation workflows using Airflow or Prefect (similar to Cruise’s AV map update pipelines).
- Optimize ETL processes for batch and real-time anomaly detection at scale.
- Enhance speed limit validation accuracy with ML models deployed via AWS SageMaker.

## Contributions
Pull requests are welcome! Feel free to contribute improvements or report issues.

## My Role & Industry Experience
At Cruise, my work focused on:
- Automating data validation workflows, integrating Python scripts and SQL-based anomaly detection.
- Building and optimizing geospatial data pipelines, ensuring 95%+ accuracy in labeled map data.
- Developing Looker dashboards to track data quality trends, leading to a 65% error reduction.
- Enhancing speed limit validation accuracy in ambiguous scenarios through ETL optimizations.
- Leading infrastructure improvements for geospatial data workflows, ensuring seamless AV map updates.

This project demonstrates my ability to automate data quality validation, process geospatial data at scale, and develop monitoring solutions for high-accuracy mapping systems.
