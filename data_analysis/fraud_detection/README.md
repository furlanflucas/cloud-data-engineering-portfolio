## Overview

The Fraud Detection Dashboard provides insights into transaction data to identify potential fraudulent activities. This project demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and dashboard-building skills using Looker, highlighting your ability to work with data pipelines and present actionable insights.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 10,000 records with the following columns:

- TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction.

- UserID: Unique identifier for users.

- TransactionAmount: Transaction value in USD.

- TransactionDate: Date and time of the transaction.

- Location: City of the transaction.

- Device: Device type used (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet).

- IsFlaggedFraud: Indicates whether the transaction is flagged as fraud (1 for fraud, 0 otherwise).

## Project Features

- Analyze fraudulent transactions over time.

- Visualize high-risk locations and devices.

- Create filters for dynamic, detailed analysis.

- Steps to Reproduce

### Setup the Dataset:

- Upload the fraud_detection_dataset.csv file to a SQL database.

- Configure Looker to connect to the database.

### Build the Dashboard:

- Define metrics like Total Transactions, Fraud Rate, and Average Transaction Amount.

- Create visualizations: Line charts, Bar charts, Pie charts, and Histograms.

- Add filters for transaction date, location, device type, and transaction amount.

### Tools Used

- SQL: Data manipulation and querying.

- Looker: Dashboard creation and data visualization.

### Potential Enhancements

- Integrate machine learning models to predict fraud.

- Use real-time data pipelines for continuous monitoring.

- Automate alerts for unusual activity.

### How to Use

- Open the dashboard in Looker.

- Use filters to focus on specific timeframes, locations, or devices.

- Review visualizations and key metrics for insights.
