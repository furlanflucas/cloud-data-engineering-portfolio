2. **Data Exploration**
   - Examination of datasets containing information about old businesses, their founding dates, locations, and industries.

3. **Key Analyses**
   - **Oldest Businesses by Continent:** Identification of the oldest businesses in each continent.
   - **Data Completeness:** Analysis of countries with missing data on their oldest businesses.
   - **Industry Insights:** Exploration of which business categories are most likely to endure for centuries.
